The C programming language came out of Bell Labs
in the early 1970s. The development of the C
language by Dennis Ritchie.
What is C language?
C is a general â€“ purpose programming
language that is extremely popular, simple , and flexible to
use. It is structured programming language that is machine
independent and extensively used to write various
application , Operating System like windows , and many

other complex programs like Oracle database , Git , Python
interpreter , and more.
Its Importance :
There are plenty reasons to believe that C
programming has remain active for a long time and will also.
There are many programming language that allow
developers to be more productive that with c for different
kinds of projects. Here are some reasons that c is
unbeatable , and almost mandatory , for certain
applications.
C is a great language for expressing common ideas inprogramming in a way
that most people are comfortable
with.
C is almost a portable assembly language. It is as close
to the machine as possible while it is almost universally
available for existing processor architecture.
A lot of the principle used in C for instance and for
command line parameters as well as loop constructs
and variable types.
C remains the most popular programming language
language for programming microcontrollers in
embedded systems.
C compilers can produce highly efficient code.
There are only 32 keywords; several standard function
are available which can be used for developing
programs
C is portable language; this means that c programs

written for one computer can be run on another system,
with little or no modification.
C language is small and relatively easy to learn. Its
mandatory to learn C for beginners.
C has been used to implement several major operating
systems and Kernels , including Unix , Linux , MacOS ,
and Windows.C language has its ability to extend itself.
